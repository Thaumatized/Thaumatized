Heyo!  

Please keep in mind that my github doesn't give a full picture of my programming history, as I started using git relatively late. In reality I have programmed something atleast everyweek, usually daily ever since I started back in 2018. This comes with the notable exception of being a recruit in the Finnish Defence Forces.  

I want note also that Githubs contribution history isn't a valid way of testing that claim. Honestly it is a really bad measure of ones productivity anyways. If there are no visible contributions for a week it either means that there are commits waiting for a merge or that what ever I did that day got squashed into a repository and thus is counted as contribution for a later week or that I have been working on something which wont show up on github contribution history at all, be that by not being on a vcs at all or by being on another vcs platform or by being on a fork.

Anyways, here's the basics of me;  

I am working in as a junior software engineer for SADE Innovations.  

Check out my personal website, which I host my self!

As for programming, my experience goes as follows:  
C#: Lots of experience. Babys first language, used for games and bots and some miscellanious programs. I don't use C# anymore.  
Python: A whole lot of experience. Go to messing around language. My relationship with python is definitely a love-hate one.  
PHP: A lot of experience. My personal website runs on php.  
SQL: An obvious companion for PHP.  
JavaScript: Quite a bit of experience. Besides boring front end scripting I have also made a few games with it.  
C: Currently the most common language for new personal projects.  
TypeScript: I am getting paid to use it.  
Java: Had to use a bit for work and used for a bit for fun. It is just worse C#.
