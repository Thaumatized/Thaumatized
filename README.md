Heyo!  

Please keep in mind that my github doesn't give a full picture of my programming history, as I have been programming for years but only started using git recently. In reality I have programmed something atleas everyweek, usually daily ever since I started back in 2018. This comes with the exception of being a recruit in the finnish defence forces.  

Anyways, here's the basics of me;  

I am currently in serving in the finnish army, as a programmer/sysadmin and teamleader of the "Virtual Learning Enviorement" of Säkylä.  

I have three websites, one of which is actually in a usable state and the two others just waiting for me to have more time in my hands.  
"https://thaumatek.fi"  
"https://pussyhub.fi"  
"https://ankkapeli.fi"  

As for programming, my experience goes as follows:  
C#: Lots of experience. Babys first language, used for games and bots and some miscellanious programs.  
Python: A whole lot of experience. Go to messing around language. My relationship with python is definitely a love-hate one.  
PHP: A lot of experience. Backends are way more suitable for me, this goes for PHP too.  
JavaScript: Quite a bit of experience. JavaScript only has a sinlge purpose, so take a guess what I have done with it.  

C/C++: Tried, going to use more.
