Heyo!  

Please keep in mind that my github doesn't give a full picture of my programming history, as I have been programming for years but only started using git recently. In reality I have programmed something atleast everyweek, usually daily ever since I started back in 2018. This comes with the notable exception of being a recruit in the finnish defence forces. If there are no visible contributions for a week it either means that there are commits waiting for a merge or that I have been working on something which wont become a public git repository ever.

Anyways, here's the basics of me;  

I am working in IT for Sporttikone.  

I have three websites, one of which is actually in a usable state and the two others just waiting for me to have more time in my hands.  
"https://thaumatek.fi"  
"https://pussyhub.fi"  
"https://ankkapeli.fi"  

I have also made "https://avaratmi.fi"

As for programming, my experience goes as follows:  
C#: Lots of experience. Babys first language, used for games and bots and some miscellanious programs.  
Python: A whole lot of experience. Go to messing around language. My relationship with python is definitely a love-hate one.  
PHP: A lot of experience. Backends are way more suitable for me, this goes for PHP too.  
SQL: Used enough to get along with and aware of common security holes.  
JavaScript: Quite a bit of experience. Besides boring front end scripting I have also made a few games with it.  

C: New to, but currently working on a project with it.
